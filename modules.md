# Modules

We used to have only accessibility modifiers on class level in Java. Module is way to encapsulate classes in our code. That means, we can control what is accessible from our library. 

Modules helps us to avoid big ball of mud, aka big ball of classes loaded from all the jars. Which means, we could optimize number of classes that are loaded into memory. That should result in smaller memory foot print. 

Module system is not mandatory. We can create apps or libraries without module system.
